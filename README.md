# Sports News Site

Sports news site is a site that aims to provide users with access to recent news articles from three different sports, which are football, tennis and boxing.
The site offers users a chance to register an account, and therefore to login and logout of the site whenever they choose.
When logged in, users are able to view posts uploaded by other users, which include information such as the user's name, and the time that the post was created.
Users of the site can also leave comments on other posts, and can see whether their comments have been approved by the site admin or are awaiting approval.
The site admin is able to manage all posts by creating, reading, updating or deleting them.
The site admin is also able to manage all user comments by choosing whether or not to approve them.

## Credits

### Content

- This project was built using the steps from the code institute django codestar blog walkthrough project.
- I followed the steps of the walkthrough project for guidance on setting up the site, and edited the post model so that I could filter the posts by each sport.
- Once completed, I edited some of the text and background colors in the css file, and created additional views, urls, and templates for the pages displaying the posts of each individual sport.
